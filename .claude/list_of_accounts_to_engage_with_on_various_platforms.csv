X,Quote,"Everyone thought the implementation of electronic health records would be a massive upgrade in efficiency and productivity. 

Then we regulated it so that only cumbersome, outdated software was allowed in Medicare. We let incumbents write the rules regulating the market. They throttled competition and ensured we were left with crap that not only failed to deliver on the promise of technology but actually made the practice of medicine worse. It drove thousands of doctors into early retirement and transformed the art of medicine into the slog of data entry.

Are these complaints well founded? Of course they are! But simply complaining about it won't change much. It will just make the doctors' lounge more insufferable.

Should we lobby congress to get things change? Only if you want to achieve incremental change at a glacial pace in one of the most expensive ways possible.

Or, since physicians make the gears of the healthcare system run, we can simply stop participating in the games. Stop taking health insurance, stop working with large health systems. That is how real change actually happens.
