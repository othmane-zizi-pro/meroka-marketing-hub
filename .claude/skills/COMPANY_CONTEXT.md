## About Meroka

**Mission:** "Saving independence in medicine"

Meroka is building a collective of independent physician practice owners at scale to give them the power to stand their ground against "the system" that pressures them toward consolidation.

### How Meroka Helps:

1. **Tech Products** - Reduce administrative costs and burden (billing, prior auth, documentation)
2. **Revenue Diversification** - Facilitate cash-pay services for non-Medicare patients, helping practices diversify beyond insurance dependency
3. **Succession Solutions** - Community/tech products addressing the succession question when independent physician owners retire
4. **Liquidity Fund** - Provide liquidity without requiring control, helping practices through financial crunches without selling out to PE or health systems

### Core Principle:
Collective power without loss of control. Physicians remain owners and leaders of their practices while gaining the leverage and sustainability that comes from scale.

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Independent physician practice owners and their care teams

These are physicians who:
- Own and operate their own practices (not employed by hospitals/health systems)
- Face pressure from consolidation, private equity, and large health systems
- Deal with administrative burden: prior auth, insurance denials, EMR frustrations
- Value autonomy and patient relationships over corporate efficiency metrics

## Tone and Voice

- Direct and honest ("Bedside Manner")
- Urgent but not alarmist
- Fun and engaging (memes, cultural commentary)
- Pro-independence, anti-consolidation stance
- Physician-first perspective

## Voices from the Field (Twitter/X Content)

Model account: **@DGlaucomflecken** - Dr. Will Flanary, ophthalmologist who creates viral satirical content

### Content Style to Prioritize:
- **Humorous/satirical** takes on healthcare bureaucracy
- **Relatable** physician frustrations (prior auth, EMR, admin burden)
- **High engagement** content that physicians share with colleagues
- **Punchy, shareable** format (not long threads or academic takes)
- **Anti-system** commentary that names the real villains (insurance, PE, admin bloat)

### High-Priority Account Types:
1. Physician comedians/satirists (DGlaucomflecken, GomerBlog, ZDoggMD)
2. Outspoken physician advocates who speak truth to power
3. Independent practice advocates
4. Physicians who call out system dysfunction

### Topics That Resonate:
- Prior authorization nightmares
- Insurance denials and appeals
- EMR/EHR frustrations (Epic, charting, note bloat)
- Administrative burden vs patient care
- Private equity in healthcare
- Burnout and moral injury
- Peer-to-peer review absurdity

### Avoid:
- Purely academic/research content
- Self-promotional threads (new book, podcast, etc.)
- Negative content about physicians themselves
- Overly political content (see political neutrality guidelines)

## The Stakes

When independent medicine erodes:
- Access becomes broader but thinner
- Costs rise (facility fees, opaque pricing)
- Care becomes rushed, distant, fragmented
- Physicians face burnout and moral injury

## Hero/Villain Framing

**Hero:** Care Teams - physicians, clinicians, staff delivering care on the front lines

**Villain:** The System - profit-first incentives, consolidation, private equity, large institutions optimizing for extraction over outcomes
