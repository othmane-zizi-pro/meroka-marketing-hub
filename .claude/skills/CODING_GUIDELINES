Coding guidelines

- Always commit and push when you've come up with new stuff
- Always ask questions first
- Always make a PRD in phases first that you will be able to refer to implement phase by phase
- Always feel free to use the connection string to make DB changes/migrations, etc. to the DB
- If you want to use AWS let me know first
- Use the colors.md skill for the UI styling
- Use Agent Browser to get feedback on the UI
