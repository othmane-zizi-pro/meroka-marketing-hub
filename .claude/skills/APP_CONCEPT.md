We are creating an agentic marketing app for my company. All employees will be able to connect through Google OAuth (restricted to Meroka domains). The app will be organized around "channels" (e.g. LinkedIn, X, Instagram, etc.). Within each channel there will be continuous marketing by using a list of accounts that we want to engage with, then with an API we will read those posts and with an LLM orchestration workflow (and sometimes also using other deterministic scripts to render memes as well, suggesting not just a written post but also a picture that comes with it) we will react in a way that is brand-aligned. The app should not handle the posting itself through the API. Rather, it should propose posts in a feed and every post can be liked and commented by company members connected on the app, even "approved" by people with specific roles and submitted for approval by others with other roles. On a specific channel we will be able to create campaigns which are speicifc initiatives outsides of the continuous mareketing/community engagement efforts. For example there can be a campaign where we will feature employee voices, and if we click on that campaign within a given platform we'll be able to see posts suggested for every employee. These posts will be able to be both thought leadership given the specific speciality of the employee but also Meroka (our comapany) ambassadorship by communication the mission and values through the post (there is a @COMPANY_CONTEXT.md you can refer to to understand the company).

For the employee voices campaign:


We will use the voice of individuals in our company to create snippets in their voice and according to their speciality (the AI guy, the marketing person, etc.) and have an app that will autogenerate posts in their voice (3 every day), and users will be able to upvote and comment on posts, and the goal is to have the most upvoted appear if we choose this view, and the person it is about is able to edit those posts. in the settings for this campaign we need a way for specific users to train their agents on their personal settings page by addings posts to few shots, and context about themselves, while being able to test outputs. the medium is LinkedIn. The posts should convey a great image/culture and showcase the skills and personalities of the people featured in their voice.
