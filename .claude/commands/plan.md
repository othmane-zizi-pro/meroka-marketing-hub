# /plan

Create a detailed plan/PRD before implementing a feature.

## Instructions

When the user asks for a feature or significant change:

1. **Think deeply** about the request - consider edge cases, technical feasibility, and dependencies
2. **Research** the codebase and relevant APIs to understand what's possible
3. **Ask clarifying questions** if requirements are unclear
4. **Create a phased PRD** with:
   - Overview of what's being built
   - Technical feasibility assessment (especially for API integrations)
   - Phase breakdown with clear deliverables
   - Database migrations needed
   - New API endpoints required
   - UI/UX considerations
   - Potential blockers or risks
5. **Present the plan** and wait for user approval before implementing
6. Only start implementation after explicit go-ahead

Do NOT start coding until the user approves the plan.
